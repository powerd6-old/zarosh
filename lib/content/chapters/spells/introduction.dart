# Introduction

Magic is a volatile, unpredictable and wild component of the world.

There were times where the risk taken to learn and use spells was considered too high, and magic fell into disuse.
However, the ability to bend reality at your own will is always useful, so groups focused into understanding magic as best they could.

After millennia of studies, magic is still a mystery, however, it's use is now much more common.
Magic schools, devoted to specific areas of research were created throughout the land, searching for true understanding of the now called art they admire.

For most people, magic is now an impressive skill, but not uncommon.
For those skilled enough to use it, magic is an extension of their own will.
