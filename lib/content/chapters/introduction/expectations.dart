Zarosh is the "default" game world for powerd6.

As such, it is a great point to start, but not really required for play.

While Zarosh offers a vast land full of magical creatures and tricky situations, it makes some assumptions in it's world-building that might not suit every adventure. Feel free to change, tweak or even disregard any piece of information in this book for the sake of fun.
