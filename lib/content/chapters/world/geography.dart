# Geography

Zarosh has three vast continents, each with their own varied biomes.

## Toloc

In the north-west corner of the world lies the lush and wild archipelagoes of Toloc, an isolated set of islands that have always captivated people's imagination.

Surrounded by a sea filled with dangerous monsters, the archipelago was considered unreachable to the common folk for millennia.

However, in the more recent years, endeavours have opened the isolated islands to the rest of the world.

### Mount Ghiz

On the central portion of the archipelago an active volcano breaks the otherwise flat landscape. This volcano is known as Mount Ghiz, where Ghize currently resides.

### Droug

In the northeaster portion of the archipelago, on an almost circular island, the harrowing swamps of Droug cover the land with their treacherous terrain.

It is believe that the island itself is comprised of Drougo's body, but a combination of dangerous terrain, with even more dangerous inhabitants have made verification difficult, to say the least.

## Vatu'un

Vatu'un is a vast continent in the south that is considered to be the birthplace of civilization as we know it.

However, multiple disasters-natural or otherwise- have left the land barren and dry.

### Greisho

Old texts describe Greisho as paradise: lush, green, fertile and prosperous. However, the current situation couldn't be further from that description.

The giant sand-dunes of the Greisho desert have swallowed and covered any signs of that once-prosperous civilization.

Now, the inhabitants in this area live to explore the dangerous, sunken ruins. Sliko, an inhabitant of the original paradisical Greisho, still can be found wandering the deserts and it's ruins.

### Azure Fell

Little is known about how Azure Fell ended up at the bottom of the ocean.

Located in the north-eastern portion of Vatu'un, the metropolis-sized city in the depths is now inhabited by deep-sea creatures.

## Sin Ale'Hi

The sheer size of Sin Ale'Hi make it difficult to describe the continent as a whole. Taking the entire eastern portion of the world, this huge continent has it all: From the northern sharp peaks, thru the dense ancient forest, all the way to the rash plains in the south.

### Zuruk

In the north, the multiple peaks of rock and ice form a most inhospitable land. With snow year-round, Zuruk bears its fangs with cave-ins, avalanches and lots of deadly drops.

### Suk'Ha

Suk'Ha is a large mountain range in the center of the continent. It is covered by hard minerals, that helped it withstand the erosion over millennia.

There is, however, a flat portion on the mountain range. At it's center, a large crater splits the mountains in half and reveal multiple ancient serpentine tunnels.

Suk'Ha separates the cold north from the rest of the otherwise green continent.

### Zal Ale'hi

Zal Ale'hi is an ancient forest, as old as the land itself. Multiple people have lived and depended on it over the course of history, and it has always provided.

It is believe that the ancient trees are all linked together, but no one was able to obtain any proof of that, as the natives consider the tree and soil on the forest sacred.
