# History

A long time ago, on this day, the world started breaking apart -not that it wasn't already a broken mess-, and the War of the Deities -which really is more of a tantrum than anything- began.

In a tavern smelling of stew, ale, and smoke was Impha, the deity of fun and comedy. After a drink too many, the trickster decided to play a prank and send a gift of dubious taste to a most unreasonable fellow, Verot. We all know Verot is not the most approachable of the twelve, and to the surprise of no one, he was not happy.

The gift was a magical scroll. Every time it was opened its contents would change, never making any sense. This frustrated and puzzled Verot, as something he could not understand would be the most unbecoming to the god of knowledge himself.

Puzzled, he decided to look for the gift-giver in order to understand the terrible twisted motives behind such a cruel gift. Impha, completely drunk at the time, had no recollection of such a gift, and sent Verot out into a wild chase.

In his fury, Verot reached out to a trusted friend, Sliko, a then very effective merchant, and now the deity of commerce. "A magical scroll capable of fooling the wisest of creatures couldn't possibly be created by anyone else other than Khzhlx", the pair concluded blinded by fear and envy. The two had noticed that Khzhlx held insurmountable power, capable of dethroning all other deities and reducing them into mere mortal if so desired.

In an elaborate scheme, Sliko and Verot sealed Khzhlx's power, going behind all of the agreements of the then present council of the gods. This in turn, brought the wrath of Rayke, the deity of war, and Glim, the deity of protection.

Talks were held immediately on the flowery green hills of Greisho. A spring like that would never return, and "green" would stop being used to describe the region.

In their stone thrones, Glim discoursed about the injustice dealt to Khzhlx, without any proof or approval, while Rayke complemented the conversation pointing to the fact that none of them should ever suffer such destiny.

The conversations were progressing slowly, and boringly, until I, Thol, raised my voice. "Khzhlx was not the one that sent the gift", I said as I sat down again, ready to appreciate the turmoil that was to come.

If my intents were to increase the tensions, or simply give my equals the opportunity to entertain that poor Impha would be capable of such a blunder in her inebriated state, I leave to the reader's discretion. "Both", is probably the answer.

Verot, drunk on his own pride, insisted that he had saved them all from Khzhlx. Discontent with his response, Raike and Glim unleashed their fury. And as such came the end of the last meeting of the council, and started the beginning of the end of the world as we know it.
